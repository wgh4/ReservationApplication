The idea of this application is to create a reservation app for the local soccer club.
The soccer club has 4 training pitches and this app allows a trainer to reserve a training pitch for a specific team on a specific date.

The reservation date is a mandatory field.

A pitch can be only reservered once on a specific timeslot (timeslot = one hour) - SQL CONSTRAINT on reservationdate and pitch

The app lists only all reservations from today and in the future
